Assignment: Final


This assignment gave me some room to practice HTML, CSS, and Flask. It's not the craziest website, but I think it looks pretty decent. The first page is a home page, with the required information, the second is a page that keep strack of weather in cities that you input, semi-following a tutorial whose link is in the commits. The final page is a repository of broadsword practice videos that I use occasionally! I hope the website is enjoyable.
